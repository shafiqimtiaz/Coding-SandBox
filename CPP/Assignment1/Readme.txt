Assignment Submission

1. For each assignment, create an assignment folder named A# StudentID, where
# denotes the assignment number and StudentID denotes your student ID number.
For example, student with ID number 7654321 would create assignment folders named
A1 7654321, A2 7654321, A3 7654321, and so on.

2. Place the implementation (.cpp) files, header (.h) files, and input/output files for your
assignment in your A# StudentID assignment folder.
Do not submit any IDE generated files as their large size may saturate your overall upload
storage quota.
Regardless of the C++ IDE you use to develop your programs, be sure that the assignment
graders can compile and run your programs on the computers in ENCS Computer Labs.

3. Place a README.txt text file in your folder; it should contain:
(a) the assignment number
(b) your name and ID,
(c) any special instructions on how to run and use your program,
(d) a list of extra features (if any) in your program,
(e) a list of any known bugs (if any) in your program, and
(f) any notes you wish the TA/instructor to consider while grading your programs.

4. Compress (Zip) your A# StudentID folder to a file named A# StudentID.zip.

5. Submit your zipped file A# StudentID.zip at the course Moodle page. You may
submit your assignment only once, so make sure it is your final copy.

6. Retain a copy of all your term work until you receive a final grade for the course.
